# Receipts

For information look at Issue #2 and also this [discussion thread](https://github.com/ACES-RMDSSOE/receipts/discussions/1). You can use `.js`/`.jsx` files if you want but when project is finished we will migrate to `.ts`/`.tsx`, read about the technologies below (App router VImp). Any questions make an issue or discussion or ask in WP group
